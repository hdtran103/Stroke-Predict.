# Stroke Prediction Project

## Business Problem and Stakeholders

Our goal is to create a computer program that can predict if someone is likely to have a stroke. Doctors and healthcare workers are the people who will use this program to help them take care of patients.

## Data Source

We used information from a big survey called NHANES to make our program. This survey asked people questions about their health and collected data like their age, gender, weight, and blood pressure.

## Data Description

We looked at many different things in the data to understand what could cause a stroke. Some important things we considered were how old someone is, if they smoke, and if they have any other health problems like high blood pressure or diabetes.

## Analytical Insights

1. Age: We noticed that most of the people in the survey who had a stroke were older, around 60 years old. This tells us that as people get older, they might have a higher chance of having a stroke. So, doctors should pay extra attention to older patients and make sure they get the right tests and treatments.

2. Weight and Blood Pressure: We found that people who weigh more tend to have higher blood pressure. High blood pressure can increase the risk of having a stroke. So, it's important for everyone to try and keep a healthy weight by exercising and eating well, which can help keep their blood pressure in a good range.

## Model Metrics

Our program is pretty good at predicting strokes. Here are some numbers that show how well it works:

- Accuracy: 85% (which means it's right about 85% of the time)
- Precision: 88% (which means when it says someone might have a stroke, it's right about 88% of the time)
- Recall: 76% (which means it can find about 76% of the people who might have a stroke)
- F1 Score: 81% (which is a way to measure how balanced the program is between being right and finding the right people)

## Business Problem Solvability

Our program can help doctors and healthcare workers by giving them a better idea of who might be at risk of having a stroke. This way, they can take steps to prevent strokes or treat them early, which can save lives and make people healthier.

## Summary and Recommendations

Based on our program and what we learned from the data, we have some recommendations:

1. Get Regular Check-ups: It's a good idea to go to the doctor for check-ups, especially if you're older. They can check your health and find out if you have any problems that could lead to a stroke. The sooner they find out, the better they can help you.

2. Stay Healthy: It's important to keep a healthy weight by exercising and eating well. This can help keep your blood pressure in a good range and lower your chances of having a stroke.

3. Learn About Strokes: Talk to your family and friends about strokes. Learn about the signs and symptoms so you can recognize them if they happen to you or someone you know. If you think someone is having a stroke, tell an adult right away so they can get medical help.

Please remember that this is a simplified explanation, and it's important to consult with medical professionals for accurate information and advice.
